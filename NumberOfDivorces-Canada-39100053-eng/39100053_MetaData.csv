"Note ID",Note
1,"Sources: Statistics Canada, Canadian Vital Statistics—Divorce Database and Estimates of population, by marital status or legal marital status, age and sex for July 1, Canada, provinces and territories."
2,"Data in this table may differ from those released previously due to updates in the data sources and methodology."
3,"The 2019 and 2020 data are considered preliminary. The number of divorces as well as divorce rates could be underestimated."
4,"Imputation was used to replace the few missing values present in the original database."
5,"This table includes all divorces granted in Canada whether the marriage was registered in Canada or another country."
6,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
7,"Divorces are recorded in the province or territory in which they were granted by the courts. This generally corresponds to the place of residence of at least one spouse upon applying for divorce. Spouses may reside outside this province or territory at the time the divorce is granted."
8,"Data for Ontario are not available by sex or gender starting in 2018. For that reason, sex- or gender-specific totals for Canada are also unavailable starting in 2018."
9,"Statistics for Northwest Territories and Nunavut are presented separately from 2000. Prior to 2000, only statistics for Northwest Territories and Nunavut combined are available. "
10,"The data source collected information on sex up to 2020. Starting in 2021, information on gender will be collected."
11,"Age at the last birthday preceding divorce."
12,"Numbers of divorces have been rounded. The rounded numbers were used in the computation of rates and percentages."
13,"Corresponds to the number of people who divorced in a given year divided by the size of the married population (including people who are separated but still legally married) as of July 1 of the same year. For rates by sex or gender, both the numerator and denominator only include people of a given sex or gender. Divorce rates are not presented before 1991 because estimates of the married population included people in common-law unions before that year."
