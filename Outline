Population and Renting
Is there a linear relationship between population and renting in Ontario in the last 30 years?
o  Birthrate - How does the birthrate affect the increase/decrease in renting homes?
o  Immigration - How has immigration affected renting factors? Are immigrants renting more or purchasing homes?
o Family Structure - Looking a divorce, separation, marriage... what type of family renting what? Does divorce increase the number or renters? Who is renting?
o  Financials - Income versus renting, and how that has changed over the last 30 years.
Things to think about:
-         Population income changes
-         Pricing of housing increased/changed
-         Why is the price of renting so low compared to buying a home?
-         Comparing rent rates in the last 50 years
-         How has renting changed over the years?
-         What factors are affecting renting over the years?
